# README

For our project, since we read a paper and reproduced the results, we followed the direction given by the author. Those directions are:

-> due to large dataset, we downloaded author's dataset from their GitHub repository. Therefore, no special importing is required. By running the required cell in the GoogleColab code provided should already download the necessary dataset.

-> defensive distillation method, similar to our dataset, was downloaded from authors Github repository. Thus, by running the required cell in GoogleColab should take care of it. Not importing of other files necessary for it.
